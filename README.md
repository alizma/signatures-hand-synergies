## Notes

* DB5 - For feature extraction and classification, "Repetitions 1, 3, 4 and 6 were used to train the classifiers, repetitions 2 and 5 were used for validating them. The classification was performed on all movements (rest included)" in DB5, according to [this](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0186132) associated paper. 

* DB4 sampling frequency is 2000 Hz

* DB5 sampling frequency is 200 Hz, so windowing into 200 sample-sized windows (with an overlap of 50%) involves 1 second of data in each window
